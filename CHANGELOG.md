# Changelog

#### Version 3.2.0

-   new config option `selfCloseTags` added which is used as an easier global setting to enable/disable self-closing tags.

#### Version 3.1.0

-   config option `contentMap` can now be passed to transform any XML content. For instance, if you want `<a>null</a>` to instead appear as `<a></a>` you pass in `contentMap: (content) => { return content === null ? '' : content }`
-   fixed an issue with improper line breaks and indenting with null content

#### Version 3.0.0

-   **BREAKING CHANGE**: config option `attributesFilter` has been renamed `attributeReplacements`
-   **BREAKING CHANGE**: config option `filter` has been renamed `contentReplacements`
-   CDATA blocks are now untouched (no HTML entity replacements) and unindented (#56)
-   `true` attribute values can now be outputted by setting config option `attributeExplicitTrue: true` (#57)
-   attributes can now be filtered out by supplying a custom function to the new config option `attributeFilter`. For instance, to remove `null` attribute values from the output, you can supply the config option `attributeFilter: (key, val) => val === null` (#58 and #10)
-   `devDependencies`: migrated from `babel-eslint` to `@babel/eslint-parser`, migrated from `uglify-es` to `uglify-js`

#### Version 2.2.0

-   Initial support for XML comments ([#47](https://github.com/davidcalhoun/jstoxml/issues/47))

#### Version 2.1.1

-   Fix for [#48](https://github.com/davidcalhoun/jstoxml/issues/48) (various 0-depth issues, bad "is output start" logic)

#### Version 2.0.0 (breaking)

-   New: automatic entity escaping for `&`, `<`, and `>` characters. In addition, quotes `"` in attributes are also escaped (see [#41](/../../issues/41)). Prior to this, users [had to provide their own filter manually](https://github.com/davidcalhoun/jstoxml/issues/4#issuecomment-19165730). Note that `jstoxml` makes an effort not to escape entities that appear to have already been encoded, to prevent double-encoding issues.
    -   E.g. `toXML({ foo: '1 < 2 & 2 > 1' }); // -> "<foo>1 &lt; 2 &amp; 2 &gt; 1</foo>"`
    -   To restore the default behavior from `v1.x.x`, simply pass in `false` to `filter` and `attributesFilter` options:
        `toXML({ foo: '1 < 2 & 2 > 1' }, { filter: false, attributesFilter: false }); // -> "<foo>1 < 2 & 2 > 1</foo>"`

#### Version 1.6.9

-   fix for [#40](https://github.com/davidcalhoun/jstoxml/issues/47). Previously top-level objects and arrays were concatenated without proper line breaks.

#### Version 1.4.2

-   support for handling arrays of primitives, instead of simply concatenating [#33](/../../issues/33)

#### Version 1.3.0

-   restored `default` module export [#31](/../../issues/31)

#### Version 1.2.0

-   refactoring and cleanup

#### Version 1.1.0

-   Added support for attribute filtering (see Example 11b below).

#### Version 1.0.0

-   Complete rewrite! The code should now be easier to understand and maintain.
-   now supports emoji/UTF8 tag attributes (needed for AMP pages - e.g. `<html âš¡ lang="en">`) (see example 14)
-   now supports duplicate attribute key names (see example 15)
-   Fixed: functions returning objects now have now that output passed through toXML for XML conversion
-   Fixed: empty text strings now properly output self-closing tags
-   Migrated tests to mocha
